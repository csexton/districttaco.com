title: DCRA Curbside Cookoff
---

Curbside Cookoff 2010! October 7th & 8th, City Center DC.

Our amigos down at DCRA are having a food cart cook off, and if you want to see District Taco there you need to [go vote now!](http://dcra.dc.gov/DC/DCRA/For+Business/2010+Curbside+Cookoff).

This is a great way to put more District Taco in the District -- and help all the high quality food trucks in DC! Orale!
