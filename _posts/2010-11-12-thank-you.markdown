Amigos! We wanted to thank everyone for their amazing support. It has been overwhelming! So many folks giving us encouraging words and keeping the business booming. We appreciate everything our customers have done for us and want to make sure to take a moment to thank you.

Turns out that running a restaurant is very different than running a cart, and it is taking us some time to hit our stride and provide good food fast, especially with our new expanded menu. We are constantly examining and refining how we do things and we are very confident we will find the right way to create delicious meals for you and your family. Thank you for being patient and if you have any feed back feel free to let us know. We like to know where we can improve and what we do right.
