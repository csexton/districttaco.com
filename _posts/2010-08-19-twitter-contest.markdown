Amigos, in an effort to continue to expand our social network, we are starting a series of contests at District Taco.

Our first contest starts today.  The goal is to get to 10,000 followers on Twitter.  
If we reach 10,000 followers, District Taco will set up a cart and serve FREE tacos that day!

That's right, 10,000 followers on Twitter = Free tacos for everyone.

If you like free tacos, [click here to follow us on twitter right now](http://twitter.com/districttaco)!

Â¡Orale!
