title: District Taco Loves Facebook
---

We just launched our Free Tacos for the Day contest asking people to follow us on Twitter. Being big fans of Facebook, we didn't want to exclude our friends on there! So we are modifying the contest to include Facebook friends.

**If we reach 10,000 followers/friends, District Taco will set up a cart and serve FREE tacos that day**

If you like Free District Tacos then [friend us on Facebook now](http://facebook.com/districttaco) -- and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/districttaco)! Yes, you can be counted twice, and yes we want to have a free taco day as much as you do. It will be a feista! Orale!
